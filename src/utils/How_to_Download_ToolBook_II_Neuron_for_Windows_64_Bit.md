However, ToolBook II Neuron is only compatible with Windows 32 bit operating systems. If you have a Windows 64 bit operating system, you will not be able to install or run ToolBook II Neuron directly. Fortunately, there is a workaround that can help you use ToolBook II Neuron on your Windows 64 bit computer. Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Download ToolBook II Neuron from the official website[^1^]. The file size is about 29.2 MB. Save the file to a location of your choice.
2. Download and install a virtual machine software that can run Windows 32 bit operating systems, such as VirtualBox or VMware Workstation Player. These are programs that allow you to create and run virtual computers inside your main computer. You can find them online for free or for a fee, depending on the features you need.
3. Create a new virtual machine with Windows 32 bit as the operating system. You will need a Windows 32 bit installation disc or ISO file, and a valid product key. Follow the instructions of the virtual machine software to set up the virtual machine.
4. Start the virtual machine and install ToolBook II Neuron inside it. You can copy the file from your main computer to the virtual machine using a shared folder or a USB drive. Follow the installation wizard to complete the process.
5. Launch ToolBook II Neuron from the virtual machine and enjoy using it on your Windows 64 bit computer.

Note: Running ToolBook II Neuron on a virtual machine may affect its performance and speed, depending on your computer's specifications and settings. You may need to adjust the memory, CPU, and graphics allocation of the virtual machine to optimize it for ToolBook II Neuron.
  
## How to Use ToolBook II Neuron
 
ToolBook II Neuron has a graphical user interface that allows you to create and modify neurons and networks of neurons. You can also use a scripting language called Hoc to write commands and scripts for more advanced functions. ToolBook II Neuron comes with a library of predefined neuron models and network models that you can use as templates or modify as you wish. You can also import and export neuron models and network models from other sources.
 
To use ToolBook II Neuron, you need to follow these basic steps:

1. Select a neuron model or a network model from the library or create your own. You can use the toolbar, the menu, or the Hoc console to access the different features and options of ToolBook II Neuron.
2. Set the parameters and properties of the neuron model or the network model, such as the morphology, the ion channels, the synapses, the stimuli, and the recording devices. You can use the graphical tools or the Hoc commands to do this.
3. Run the simulation and observe the results. You can use the Run Control window to start, stop, pause, and resume the simulation. You can also use the Graph window to plot the voltage, current, conductance, or other variables of interest. You can also use the Shape Plot window to visualize the shape and color of the neurons and networks.
4. Analyze and interpret the results. You can use the Graph window or the Hoc console to perform calculations and statistics on the data. You can also use the Save window or the Hoc commands to save the data or export it to other formats.

ToolBook II Neuron has a comprehensive online help system that explains all the features and functions of the software in detail. You can access it by clicking on Help in the menu bar or pressing F1 on your keyboard. You can also find tutorials, examples, documentation, and support on the official website of ToolBook II Neuron.
